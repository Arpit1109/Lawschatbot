       "'Observance of the Law Emperor Sung of China in 959 A.D. was able to turn all his enemies into loyal friends. He persuaded his generals to retire to a life of nobility and give up their dreams of\\n\\nwww.bizsum.com\\n\\n© 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com\\n\\nThe 48 Laws Of Power\\n\\nPage 3\\n\\ngrabbing his throne one day. He spared those who conspired against him, and was able to win over enemies with his generosity.\\n\\nWisdom in a nutshell:\\n\\nDo not rely on friends. They will never be totally honest with you. They will not openly disagree with you in order to avoid arguments.\\n\\nEnemies expect nothing so they will be surprised when you are generous. • An enemy spared the guillotine will be more grateful to you than a friend. • When you decide to hire a friend you will discover qualities she has kept hidden. • Skill and competence are more important than friendly feelings. • Hiring friends will limit your power. • All working situations require a kind of distance between people. • You destroy an enemy when you make a friend of him. • An enemy at your heels keeps you sharp, alert, and focused.\\n\\n3. CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS.\\n\\nTransgression of the Law. The Marquis de Sevigne was young and inexperienced in the art of love. He confided in the infamous courtesan of seventeenth-century France, Ninon de Lenclos, to instruct him on how to seduce a difficult young countess. She made him follow a plan over a number of weeks, where the Marquis would be appearing in public always surrounded by beautiful women, in the very places the countess would be expected to see him. He was supposed to assume an air of nonchalance. This increased the jealousy of the young countess, who was not sure of his interest in her. One day the Marquis, unable to control his passion, broke from Ninon’s plan, and blurted out to the countess that he loved her. After this admission, the countess no longer found him interesting and avoided him.\\n\\nObservance of the Law Otto von Bismarck was a deputy in the Prussian parliament at a time when many fellow deputies thought it was possible to go to war against Austria and defeat it. Bismarck knew the Prussian army was not prepared, so he devised a clever way to keep the war at bay. He publicly stated his praises for the Austrians and talked about the madness of war. Many deputies changed their votes. Had Bismarck announced his real intentions, arguing it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not have won. Most Prussians wanted to go to war at that moment and mistakenly believed their army to be superior to the Austrians. Had he gone to the king his sincerity would have been doubted. By giving misleading statements about wanting peace and concealing his true purpose, Bismarck’s speech catapulted him to the position of prime minister. He later led the country to war against the Austrians at the right time, when he felt the Prussian army was more capable.\\n\\nWisdom in a nutshell:'"

Napoleon was recaptured at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to the barren  island St. Helena, off the west coast of Africa.
